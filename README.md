# smartMarkets
The project I did for my final year high school thesis.

My idea came up by thinking, "What can be useful to the majority of people?". The answer is the most obvious of all, and my idea is based on exactly that...money. Everyone wants to spend as little money as possible, so I wanted to offer a service that would allow people to save both time and money when they go to the supermarket.
To do this I made a website and an application, on this website users have to create an account, and after they can put in their shopping list the specific product they want to buy, this is because each product has a unique barcode.
So after adding all the products to the cart, the system shows to the user which supermarkets have the best price, the best rating and are closest.
In this way, a person who has to do the supermarket shopping, discovers immediately if a supermarket does not have all the products he needs, and then can understand, before leaving home, which supermarket is more suitable for his needs.
The project, however, to work requires that all supermarkets register and enter what products they sell and at what price.
